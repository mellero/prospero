Site generated using Gatsby as the front-end, and WAMP as the backend. All WAMP code included in the WAMP directory. Current code is the third iteration of the project, which has had the following path:
- Part 1: Simple HTML and CSS mock-up of main pages (Landing, Search, sample Product). Assembled using html skeletons, .sed files, and makefiles.
- Part 2: JavaScript functionality - here Gatsby was used. Replaces all makefiles with Gatsby's build chain. Sample JS product array used to test and demonstrate JS functionality.
- Part 3: Backend functionality added - A separate WAMP instance was created to manage and control the backend, including the MySQL database. Products migrated to database, and an add-product page was included to grow product DB.
